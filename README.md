Before running this program, make sure you have the John Zelle python graphics library installed. Follow the directions on this site to do so: https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/resources/Python/ZelleGraphics.html.

To run this program, download the repository, use the terminal to navigate into the Chess directory, and type "python3 Chess.py" into the terminal followed by enter. Players take turns using the same computer and can move a piece by clicking on a desired piece followed by the position where the player would like to place the piece. If the move is not a legal one, the move will simply not occur, and the player can reselect a piece followed by the desired new position. The majority of the code was generated by using OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can be accessed at https://chat.openai.com/chat. However, some bug fixes were done by hand.
